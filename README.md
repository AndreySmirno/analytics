If you are here you should notice that there is no ready solutions and this repository is a hub of pieces of code or structures. 

Mainly repository used for testing hypothesys such as  "what if" and "oh, i think that will work".

So this place for temporary projects in WIP status created as parts of procedures to be done with not completed parts of code for prototyping parts or structures (which is not that good)

No solutions! No inspiration! No finished stuff to clone!
